# Potential-Replacement-of-Lionel-Messi-in-FCB

As we all know that Lionel Messi has departed FC Barcelona which has shocked the entire footballing world, I've analysed all the top players from Europe to find a potential replacement for Lionel Messi.

As per my analysis I've concluded that there isn't any player who can totally fill the void, but Societ√† Sportiva Calcio Napoli star Lorenzo Insigne. can be the one who can provide stability in the forward line up.
Having an excellent eye for goal, Insigne has been one of the most crucial players for Napoli and has been in excellent form in the recent Euro 2021 scoring 2 goals.
